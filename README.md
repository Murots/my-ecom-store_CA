An e-commerce store that outlines the key steps in the shopping process.

## Description

This e-commerce site is my first React development project, featuring a product list page where users can view items and access detailed pages with a single click. Users can easily add products to their shopping cart, which dynamically updates with a numerical icon. The cart page provides a summary and automatically calculates the total price. The site also includes a contact form for user inquiries. This project serves as a practical application of React components, state management, and basic web functionalities. The website contains the following pages:

- Homepage
